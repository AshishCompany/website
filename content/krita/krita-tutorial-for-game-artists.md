**If you want to become a better 2-D game artist, this training is for you**. It will teach you how to work with Krita, a mature open source digital painting program. In 6 chapters, we will explore the most important features krita has to offer to game artists. Cherry on the cake: the tutorials are completely free! And if you have some experience already and want to go further, I'm working on a new [Krita game art workshop](https://gumroad.com/l/krita-game-art-tutorial-1).
