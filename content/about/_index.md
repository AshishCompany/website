## GDquest's mission

GDquest's goal is to help you **become a better game designer**. It's a growing library of [ game creation tutorials ](/tutorial) and tools to help **indies**, **students** and **hobbyists** learn professional design, programming, and art techniques, all that using **Free and Open Source Software**.

With over 200 free tutorials out already on Youtube and several courses, we've already reached out to **tens of thousands of students**.

GDquest is community-driven: the last 2 projects were crowdfunded on Kickstarter and shaped with the backers' feedback:

1. [ Make Professional 2d game art with Krita ]({{< ref "product/krita/painterly-game-art/index.md" >}})
2. [ Make Professional 2d games with Godot 3 ](https://gumroad.com/l/godot-tutorial-make-professional-2d-games)

You will also many Free resources on [ GDquest's GitHub page ](https://github.com/GDquest/), including an open Godot 3 presentation, game project source code and [Power Sequencer](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer), our Blender add-on for video editors.

## The guy behind GDquest

Hey, I'm Nathan (*bottom left on the picture above*), the voice you've heard in most videos on [ Youtube ](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest). I'm currently in Nara, a large Japanese city surrounded by mountains.

I've been working in the game industry for over 5 years now, both as a game designer and an artist. We ran an indie game development company with my former teammate [ Florian ](https://twitter.com/Nemega) and worked full time on mobile and web games for 18 months together. Our first projects failed miserably, then we slowly managed to make a living off of our work. As a designer I got study all domains related to game creation so I've got some first-hand experience to help you learn from.

As we were still young and lacked experience we decided to part ways. Florian became the lead developer at Royal Cactus and I went on to work as a freelance designer and writer, still working on mobile games and [ writing game design articles ](https://gameanalytics.com/blog/how-to-make-your-game-ui-shine-and-increase-conversions.html) for companies like Game Analytics.

GDquest was a risky project. A bet to work full-time around Free Software. It turns out it worked! I like the open source ecosystem and contribute to it whenever possible with educational content, bug reports, and communication. I'm part of Godot's documentation team on GitHub and already wrote 6 of the new getting started pages for Godot 3, like the [ intro to Godot 3's design philosophy ](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/godot_design_philosophy.html) or the long [UI design intro](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/ui_game_user_interface.html).

Heck, I even write and code with [ Emacs ](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) in Vim mode! If that's not being crazy about open source... ;)
