# About GDquest

Do you want to become better at game creation? This might just be the right place for you.

Game Design Quest, or GDquest, is a educational resource for game creators. I share the techniques I've learned working as a designer for several years, and I work hard to make it easier for you to learn new tools. Students, indies, hobbyists: everyone's welcome around here!

I create [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ) weekly, but not only. I also make [tools]({{< ref "product/krita_brushes.md" >}}) to help you work more comfortably or productively, and answer many questions on Youtube or [Discord](https://discord.gg/KVaCsSP).

Talking about that...

## Get in touch!

There are a few ways for you to reach me:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/KVaCsSP) is the best place for questions or support. That's where the community and I hang out, and if I'm away, other creators will be around.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest) is nice to share short messages and pictures.

## Affiliates

I make tutorials and resources for open source programs. if you're interested in becoming an affiliate, please [send me an email](mailto:nathan@gdquest.com?subject=Affiliate%20partnership)!
