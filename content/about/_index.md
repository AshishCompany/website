Game Design Quest is a collection of online resources to help indies, students and hobbyists become better game developers, all that using Free and Open Source Software.

I'm Nathan, a French game design tutor currently living in Japan.

I create [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ) weekly, but not only. I also make [tools]({{< ref "product/krita/brushes/index.md" >}}) to help you work more comfortably or productively, and answer many questions on Youtube or Discord.

### Affiliates and collaborations

I create tutorials and resources for open source programs. You can find the catalogue in the [Gumroad shop](https://gumroad.com/gdquest). If you're interested in becoming an affiliate or need someone to write tutorials for you, please [send me an email](mailto:nathan@gdquest.com?subject=Affiliate%20partnership)!

### Get in touch!

There are a few ways for you to reach me:

- [Discord](https://discord.gg/KVaCsSP) is the best place for questions or support. That's where the community and I hang out, and if I'm away, other creators will be around.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest) is nice to share short messages and pictures.
