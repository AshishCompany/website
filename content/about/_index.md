# About GDquest

Do you want to become better at game creation? This might just be the right place for you.

Game Design Quest, or GDquest, is a educational resource for game creators. I share the techniques I've learned working as a designer for several years, and I work hard to make it easier for you to learn new tools. Students, indies, hobbyists: everyone's welcome around here!

I create [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ) weekly, but not only. I also make tools {{< ref "product/krita_brushes.md" >}} to help you work more comfortably or productively, 

Tutorials

I'm Nathan, the designer behind all that.
