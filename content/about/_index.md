## GDQuest's mission

GDQuest is a social company focused on education and bringing people together around [Free Software](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

Our mission is to **help you become a better game developer**.

We share **the techniques professionals use to make games** and open source the code for most of our projects on [our GitHub page](//github.com/GDQuest/).

## Free education

GDQuest is a growing library of [game creation tutorials](/tutorial) and [open-source projects](https://github.com/GDQuest/) to help you become the game developer you want to be. We use and support Free Software like the [Godot game engine](//godotengine.org/), [Krita](//krita.org/en/), and [Blender](//www.blender.org/).

## The story of GDQuest

![Portrait of Nathan, GDQuest founder](./img/nathan.png)

Hi, I'm Nathan, GDQuest's founder.

I've always tried to get people to work hand in hand. Helping others has been a big part of my life.

One day, I recorded a quick video tutorial to share my speed painting process with some online friends. I put it up on YouTube.

Despite my heavy accent, people asked for more. So I made some more.

Back then, I didn't know a thing about Free Software. I made game sprites in Photoshop, edited with Sony Vegas, and prototyped games with Construct 2.

One day, I stumbled upon Krita, which had just arrived on Windows. It was barely usable at first, but I could see its rich feature set and potential. A year later, a major update brought many improvements I decided to shift my focus to it.

It still had some rough edges, it was slow, but it was free. Anyone, anywhere around the globe could use it without having to pay for anything. Also, there were only a few tutorials for it.

One thing leading to another, I started to learn about the philosophy behind Free Software. Along the way, I met contributors and project maintainers who share everything they know. I learned a lot from them.

GDQuest was born like that, inspired by benevolent creators. Also, by the need for quality free education and tools. Even though we sell products, as quality content takes much work to create, we used that to fund the hundreds of free tutorials we released already and dozens of free and open-source projects we have [on our GitHub](//github.com/GDQuest).
