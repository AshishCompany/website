Hailing from sleepy and chilly south-side Coaticook, Québec.

I'm a programmer and freelancer. Lately I've been contributing to the Godot Engine and, of course, building stuff for GDQuest. Some highlights:

- The [Godot Steering AI Framework](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-steering-ai-framework) ![Godot Steering AI Framework icon](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-steering-ai-framework/raw/master/project/assets/icon.png)
- The game [Harvester](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-game-harvester) ![Harvester icon](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-game-harvester/raw/master/project/icon.png)
- A code debugger for Godot Projects for the [VSCode Godot Plugins](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geequlim.godot-tools)
- Bug fixes and a windows batch script to the GDQuest [GDScript Docs Maker](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker)
- A [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Razoric.gdscript-toolkit-formatter) for Scony's [GDScript toolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit)
