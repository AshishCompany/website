I currently live in Slatina, Romania ðŸŒ¿. I'm a programmer and freelancer.

Lately, I'm:

- Working, with Nathan Lovato, the creator of GDQuest, on a Godot 3 course after a [successful Kickstarter campaign](//www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/make-professional-2d-games-godot-engine-online-cou)
- Working on a local tech club in Slatina for spreading the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) philosophy
