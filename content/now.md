_Last update on April 9, 2017_

I am near Switzerland, in the French Alps.

Lately, I'm:

- Building a mini game art series about cel shaded art with Krita
- Preparing a Kickstarter campaign for a game design course
- [Writing articles]({{< ref "post/2017/marketing/marketing-indie-games-with-0-budget.md" >}}) as a freelancer to pay the bills
- Coding a blender add-on to make videos efficiently
- Working on the [GDquest Krita brushes]({{< ref "product/krita_brushes.md" >}})
- Improving this website
- Studying Japanese grammar and kanji
- Trail running and chinese boxing
- Occasionally writing hip-hop songs

I'm doing most of that, trying to make a living off my work so I can keep supporting open source game creators in a direct way: providing professional grade education for those tools, both paid and free.

I'm open to opportunities, especially if you need somebody to create interesting tutorials. If you're a fellow Youtuber, I love to do collab videos. It's fun, motivating, and people [seem to love that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVNOpMMbeNk). So feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:nathan@gdquest.com)!
