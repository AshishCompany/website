I’ve been in the games industry for a few years now. I made my own indie game company, worked on mobile and browser-based titles. I had a blast, but I felt like we missed quality game art tutorials.That’s why I created GDquest. GDquest is a growing library of 150+ [free game creation tutorials](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest) about game design, game art, and programming with open source technologies.

## What will I learn in this course?

- How to make beautiful 2d game assets with a painterly style
- The process professionals follow, from the concept art to the finished assets
- Art fundamentals such as value and color contrast

On top of that, if you buy the premium version, you will get step by step exercise sheets and create your own game mockup, ready to use in the game engine of your choice!

If you don't know how to use Krita, I made a [FREE Krita tutorial series]({{< ref "krita\krita-tutorial-for-game-artists.md" >}}). It's more than 6 hours long! In this course, you will learn the tools you need to work comfortably and efficiently with the program.

## To those who made this possible

I want to thank the [424 Kickstarter backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/game-art-quest-make-professional-2d-art-with-krita) who made this project possible from the bottom of my heart! Thanks to these persons, tens of thousands of people got hours of free education for Krita, and many discovered this wonderful program. This would not have been possible without you. GDquest would not have been possible without you. Many thanks!
