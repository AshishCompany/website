## What will I learn in this course?

How to make beautiful 2d game assets with a painterly style
The process professionals follow, from the concept art to the finished assets
Art fundamentals such as value and color contrast
On top of that, if you buy the premium version, you will get step by step exercise sheets and create your own game mockup, ready to use in the game engine of your choice!

## Requirements

You have some experience with drawing and digital art.
If you don't know how to use Krita, I made a FREE 6 hours long training series. You'll find all the videos on my website.
Krita is a free and open source program, and it works on all desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux). Download it here.
