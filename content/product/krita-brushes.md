Version 10 (_January 2017_) contains:

- **61 unique brush presets**
- **2 pdf documents** to help you get started with the brushes
- **Monthly updates**. More brushes and videos are already on your way!

The premium tier adds:

- **More than 30 minutes of exclusive video tutorials** to get the most out of the brushes
- The **natural media brushkit**
- Priority support

I take my time to design the presets and ensure that they are worth adding to the pack. I also use them in my daily work to ensure that they are tested thoroughly in all kinds of configurations.

## What other artists have to say

[Zhillustrator](https://twitter.com/zhille) writes: "Nathan's brush set has some essential brushes for digital painting that will ease your way into Krita's powerful brush engine. My favorites in the pack are the mix and smudge brushes. Honestly, if you like the Lite set, it's worth it, Krita is going somewhere."

- a new tutorial on cloud painting (premium)

### Version 8 - Nov 2016

- 2 textured rock brushes: these presets will allow you to add 2 types of sharp grain to your rocks, for a more believable look.
- Smear cloud: whether you want to slightly blur or completely diffuse your edges, this is a very efficient preset to do so. It blurs your painting fast and provides very good control.
- Smoke dusty: this brush can be used for both clouds and smoke. Unlike the existing cloud builder brushes, it offers some high frequency details for a richer look.
- 2 water brushes: the first water brushes are in! They're useful to paint waves, for a lake, a sea or an ocean.
- Tree leaves builder: a nice brush to quickly add detailed leaves to a piece of concept art.

### Version 7 (Oct 2016)

- 2 Rock presets: draw small, round and stylized rocks with Rock builder stylized, and detail them with the Rock_detail brush
- 3 special presets for shading: the special_shadow brush allows you to stamp simple round shadows, to place under characters and small assets. The other 2 brushes are directional shading brushes, with a sharp and a soft side.
- 2 pencil-looking brushes: one for sketching, and one for shading.
- Updated paint_old preset: I remade the preset from scratch. It is at least twice as fast, and strokes are more consistent.

### Version 6 (Sep 2016)

- 4 pixel art deform tools: pixel art-friendly Grow, Shrink, Move and Swirl tools
- 2 cloud builder brushes: the first builders are here! These presets will help you paint accurate sprite silhouettes in no time. These will work for both stylized and realistic clouds.

- Text-based install guide (pdf)
- An intro to brush families (pdf)
