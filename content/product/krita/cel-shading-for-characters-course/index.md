## Pepper and Carrot

[Pepper and Carrot](//www.peppercarrot.com/) is a free webcomic by [David Revoy](//davidrevoy.com/). It is released under the [CC-By 4.0 licence](//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). It is set in a vibrant world, and we can thank the author(s) for making it available to us. It's very common for game artists to work on an existing IP or following a certain art direction. The fact that this comic is free, as in free speech, allows us to do just that with this Krita course!
