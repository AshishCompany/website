## Become a better game developer!

With this course, you will learn to **create the main mechanics** and systems in your own games, using the Free [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Unlike in many beginner courses that show how to code a specific game step-by-step, this one will teach you **professional game creation techniques** you can apply to any type of game!
