Do you want to learn to make games, but you don't know where to start? You have little or no programming experience? This guide is for you!

## Become a game developer

We collected and reviewed dozens of **free online resources** to help you learn to make your first video games with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). 

This learning path will take you from 0 to your first full-blown games, albeit small ones.

As you are going to see, there are many great tutorials and tools that you can use to learn game creation from your bedroom for free today.

Now is a great time to learn game development.

## Why Godot? What is Godot?

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a 2D and 3D game engine with a fully-fledged editor, but it is different from the other big game engines out there. It is **Free and Open Source Software**, funded by the community, backed by large organizations like Mozilla or Microsoft, and lead by a team of passionate developers shooting for the stars. 

With **over 1000 contributors** at the time of writing, Godot is becoming more and more competitive even compared to the most significant engines in the games industry.

With separate 2D and 3D engines, an innovative design, it is already packed with a large number of features making 2D game creation fun and rewarding. The team is now working hand-in-hand with the [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) representatives to provide cutting-edge 3D in version 4.0.

Godot uses the permissive [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. This means there's no limit to what an excellent team of developers can do with it, even for commercial projects.

## Can I make my dream game?

Game creation takes time and effort. Game developers are people who continuously learn new tricks and learn to enjoy the creation process.

I cannot tell whether you will be able to create your dream project or not, depending on how crazy it is. Still, you can undoubtedly make games that people will enjoy, even alone. It will just take some time and dedication.

## Getting started with game development

The massive amount of information out there on how to get started with game development can be a real problem for newcomers. Don't worry if you fall in this category, we're here to help. In the following sections you'll find lists of **curated free online resources**, in text and/or video format, that put you on the path of creating your very own playable games using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

### Introduction: the first step in a thousand mile journey

This section is for the total beginner that has little to no idea about the game industry nor the game creation process. It introduces high-level concepts that give some insights into what is to be expected.

1. GDQuest's very own starter guide - [Become a Game Developer: How to Learn to Code]({{< ref "tutorial/game-design/godot/become-a-game-creator/first-steps-programming/index.md" >}})
1. [Sykoo](https://www.youtube.com/user/SykooTV/)'s [How To Get into Game Development! (Teachers, School, Self-Taught and MORE!)](https://youtu.be/EL_Le8B_iCo)
1. GDQuest's [Game Engines: what are they and how to choose the right one?](https://youtu.be/2tZK75R2K2c)

### Getting started with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) & your first actual game(s)

Instead of the boring step-by-step traditional approach of going over the theory and explaining the game engine interface, then going through the features etc. we're going to **focus on a hands-on approach!** Best way of learning something new is through a balanced practice-theory approach. That's why we have also included a few resources that do go through the theory, but **our recommendation is to start off with the heavy hands-on approach first** and if you get stuck or if you want to understand some game engine editor & programming concepts, then go through the theory and abstract explanations.

1. GDQuest's [Intro to GDScript for Programming Beginners](https://youtu.be/UcdwP1Q2UlU) - **fundamentals of programming using GDScript**, the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) scripting language. This is the starting place for communicating with the computer using the game engine
1. GDQuest's [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot](https://youtu.be/Mc13Z2gboEk) & it's [associated GitHub project repository](https://github.com/GDquest/Your-First-Game-Godot-2d-Platformer) - the 1st part of **a complete free course that goes through the creation steps for a Mario platformer-like clone**
1. [KidsCanCode](http://kidscancode.org/) [Mobile Game: Circle Jump](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/games/circle_jump/) - an **end-to-end game development series** going through the process of building a one-touch abstract, but attractive mobile game
1. [BornCG](https://www.youtube.com/user/cgboorman)'s [3D Roll the Ball playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ) - including a tutorial series for creating a small 3D game from scratch as the 2D & 3D engines in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) have quite a few differences between them

- Other useful resources:
    - [Godot step-by-step](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html). [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s official high-level theoretical guide that goes through the interface and features, explaining the most important ideas to get students started
    - [GDScript reference](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html). The official [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) **to bookmark** resource which explains GDScript core concepts. Every Godot game developer will, without a doubt, have to search a thing or two about GDScript and this is the no. 1 place to find the answerers

### Become a more independent developer

There comes a point, in the developer’s journey, at which **sticking with small hand-held projects (AKA tutorials) isn’t enough any more**. This section goes deeper into what game design and development is about, retaining a high-level overview.

The following resources aren’t meant to teach you how to become a full-blown professional, but rather **give you a taste of what’s to come.**

1. GDQuest's [Game Design Tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KHI3oYZfZ9nLEnQMBEhbmP8) - lots of beginner-friendly examples of how to get started on actual (small) game creation, from a designer point of view
1. [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys)' [Basic Principles of Game Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8AT01tuyrk) - high-level ideas on how to think about objectives that make a game engaging and fun. How to structure the workflow around these ideas

### Going further

After getting our feet wet in some of the introductory topics above, a natural question arises: **what now?!** This chapter explores just a few free resources that can **further your understanding about game design & development**.

_Why just a few?_ Because, as is mentioned in the introduction, there is a lot of information out there which can overwhelm beginners.

We've selected the following resources to give you a peek into the vast array of skills a game developer needs to hold or at least know about in order to be successful:

1. [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - one of our top picks because it's a fun visually engaging resource. It explores, in an easy to follow way, the idea behind fragment shaders and what can be done with them. _At the point of this writing this book is incomplete_
1. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s [Official Introductory Math Docs](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/math/) - sooner or later you'll want to **learn more about mathematics** and how to calculate different useful parameters for your game, be it for object placement in the game world (eg.: procedurally created worlds) or some other variables that influence the mechanics in some way. This is a good starting place for exploring a few math topics using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s scripting language, GDScript
1. [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) - [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s programing language is heavily inspired by [Python](https://www.python.org/) and so **we recommend you explore** core programming algorithms and data structures using it

The [next part]({{< ref "https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guides/learn-godot/developer/index.md" >}}) in this series [Godot GameDev Learner's Path: Developer's Edition]({{< ref "https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guides/learn-godot/developer/index.md" >}}) is going to explore advanced resources for the enthusiasts out there that want to further their knowledge and perhaps go from being hobbyists to actually being professionals.
