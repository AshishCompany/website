This guide is **the starting place for learning game development** with [Godot](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT): the _ultimate beginner-edition_. It covers a list of **curated online free resources** that take you from **no-programming experience whatsoever to your first full-blown game projects**, albeit small ones. Why? Because great _projects start humble_ driven by enthusiasm and a lot of work!

It's a dream come true for many gamedev. students and hobbyists out there to work in big studios that create AAA-games. But alongside the big houses, especially lately there has been a surge of indie developers that produce stunning quality video games such as (to name a few):

- [NinjaTheory](https://ninjatheory.com/)'s [Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice](https://www.hellblade.com/) - a masterpiece surpassed only by very few. It's amazing what a small team of dedicated game developers can do these days
- [RedHook](https://www.redhookgames.com/)'s [Darkest Dungeon](http://www.darkestdungeon.com/) - another masterpiece project that practically created an entirely new category of games
- [Playdead](https://playdead.com/)'s [Limbo](https://playdead.com/games/limbo/) & [Inside](https://playdead.com/games/inside/) - both of which have amazing atmosphere and stories driven through game mechanics and small puzzles rather than narration, making them unique in the industry

Game creation at this level has been, in great part, made possible with the help of game engine developers that have given their product for free, even though some of the more famous ones _limit the freedom to students and hobbyists_ that work on personal non-monetized projects.

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is unlike any other game engine out there. It relies entirely on a **small crowd-funded team that shoots for the stars**, going head-to-head against the big boys in the industry. The game engine is already packed with a ridiculous number of features making 2D-game creation both enjoying and rewarding. Apart from that the team works closely with the [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) representatives in order to push the 3D pipeline to the limit.

On top of that [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is **entirely free and open source software (FOSS)**, with the most permissive license out there - [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). This means there's no limit to what a good team of developers can do with it. **It's an amazing time for anyone wanting to be a game developer!**

## Getting started with game development

Many enthusiasts starting on a journey to learn a new topic or skill **quickly become swamped by the sheer amount of information out there**. Nowadays, the problem isn't access to information as it once was, but rather **too much scattered information**. There's also the problem that most of it **isn't exactly respectable quality**, because anyone can put anything on the internet without any filters and quality control.

That said, **we, here at [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/), have done the work for you** by creating this **curated list of free online resources** that get you from **no-programming experience to your first full-blown game projects!**

_Buckle your seatbelts, it going to be an awesome ride!_

### Introduction: the first step in a thousand mile journey

This section is for the total beginner that has little to no idea about the game industry nor the game creation process. It introduces high-level concepts that give some insights into what is to be expected.

1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s very own starter guide - [Become a Game Developer: How to Learn to Code]({{< ref "tutorial/game-design/godot/become-a-game-creator/first-steps-programming/index.md" >}})
1. [Sykoo](https://www.youtube.com/user/SykooTV/)'s [How To Get into Game Development! (Teachers, School, Self-Taught and MORE!)](https://youtu.be/EL_Le8B_iCo)
1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s [Game Engines: what are they and how to choose the right one?](https://youtu.be/2tZK75R2K2c)

### Getting started with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) & your first actual game(s)

Instead of the booooring step-by-step traditional approach of going over the theory and explaining the interface of the engine, then going through the features etc. we're going to **focus on a hands-on approach!** Best way of learning something new is through a balanced practice-theory approach. That's why we have also included a few resources that do go through the theory, but **our recommendation is to start off with the heavy hands-on resources first** and if you get stuck or if you want to understand some game engine editor & programming concepts, then go through the theory and abstract explanations.

1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s [Intro to GDScript for Programming Beginners](https://youtu.be/UcdwP1Q2UlU) - **fundamentals of programming using GDScript**, the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) scripting language. This is _mostly optional_ for people that have basic programming knowledge
1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot](https://youtu.be/Mc13Z2gboEk) & it's [associated GitHub project repository](https://github.com/GDquest/Your-First-Game-Godot-2d-Platformer) - the 1st part of **a complete free course that goes through the creation steps for a Mario platformer-like clone**
1. [KidsCanCode](http://kidscancode.org/) [Mobile Game: Circle Jump](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/games/circle_jump/) - an **end-to-end game development series** going through the process of building a one-touch abstract, but attractive mobile game
1. [BornCG](https://www.youtube.com/user/cgboorman)'s [3D Roll the Ball playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ) - including a tutorial series for creating a small 3D game from scratch as the 2D & 3D engines in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) have quite a few differences between them
1. Other useful resources:
    - [Godot step-by-step](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html). [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s official high-level theoretical guide that goes through the interface and features, explaining the most important ideas to get students started
    - [GDScript reference](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html). The official [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) **to bookmark** resource which explains GDScript core concepts. Every Godot game developer will, without a doubt, have to search a thing or two about GDScript and this is the no. 1 place to find the answerers

### Become a more independent developer

There comes a point, in the developer’s journey, at which **sticking with small hand-held projects (AKA tutorials) isn’t enough any more**. This section goes deeper into what game design and development is about, retaining a high-level overview.

The following resources aren’t meant to teach you how to become a full-blown professional, but rather **give you a taste of what’s to come.**

1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s [Game Design Tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KHI3oYZfZ9nLEnQMBEhbmP8) - lots of beginner-friendly examples of how to get started on actual (small) game creation, from a designer point of view
1. [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys)' [Basic Principles of Game Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8AT01tuyrk) - high-level ideas on how to think about objectives that make a game engaging and fun. How to structure the workflow around these ideas

### Going further

After getting our feet wet in some of the introductory topics above, a natural question arises: **what now?!** This chapter explores just a few free resources that can **further our understanding about game design & development**.

_Why just a few, you ask?_ Because as is mentioned in the introduction, there is a loooooot of information out there and beginners can easily get swamped by it.

_We're on a journey and it has just begun!_

We've selected the following resources to give you a peek into the vast array of skills a game developer needs to hold or at least know about in order to be successful:

1. [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - one of our top picks because it's a fun visually engaging resource. It explores in an easy to follow way the idea behind fragment shaders and what can be done with them. _at the point of this writing this book is incomplete_
1. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s [Official Introductory Math Docs](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/math/) - sooner or later you'll want to **learn more about mathematics** and how to calculate different useful parameters for your game, be it for object placement in the game world (think of procedurally created world) or some other variables that influence the mechanics in some way. This is a good starting place for exploring a few math topics using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s scripting language, GDScript
1. [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) - [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s programing language is heavily inspired by [Python](https://www.python.org/) and so **we recommend you explore** core programming algorithms and data structures using it

The [next part]({{< ref "https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guides/learn-godot/developer/index.md" >}}) in this series [Godot GameDev Learner's Path: Developer's Edition]({{< ref "https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/guides/learn-godot/developer/index.md" >}}) is going to explore advanced resources for the enthusiasts out there that want to further their knowledge and perhaps go from being a hobbyists to actually being a professional.
