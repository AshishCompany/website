_For a gentler introduction to the concept of game development using [Godot] please refer to our previous guide: [Learn to Make Games with Godot: Beginner Edition]({{< ref "open-source/guides/learn-godot/beginner/index.md" >}})._

If you are a game developer or advanced hobbyist and you want to explore or learn [Godot], we have gathered and curated a list of resources to make your life easier while transitioning and/or starting out with [Godot].

## Making games with [Godot]

The Free and Open Source Software, [Godot], although having had modest beginnings - founded by Juan Linietsky ([@reduzio](https://twitter.com/reduzio)) & Ariel Manzur (punto), it now grows exponentially aiming to be a real competitor against the state-of-the-art game engines out there.

**[Godot] offers interconnected 2D and 3D** engines under the same editor, with a wide range of features, covering the spectrum for both hobbyists and professional game developers alike.

We believe the following curated list of educational resources will help you transition and learn [Godot] with ease. It is aimed at game developers with some experience and/or coming from a different game engine.

### From X to [Godot]

At the time of this writing, there are a few places where you can learn about the differences between other game engines and [Godot] helping out smoothing the transition:

- [coming from Unity](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/editor/unity_to_godot.html) - the official [Godot] documentation caters to Unity users covering the conceptual differences between these editors
- [coming from GameMaker: Studio](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsiR7DILTcxma-doUnpoALIX001NvcP_) - Emilio's YouTube series covers the basics of transitioning from GameMaker: Studio v1.4

### [Godot] UI, themes & much more

One of the more confusing parts of [Godot], due to conceptual differences in how the engine treats UI-related objects compared to play-related objects, is the use of themes and how to create user interfaces. [Godot] has quite a powerful theming mechanism, but it's not exactly the friendliest developer experience.

To get you started with UI, themes and much more we have gathered the following educational resources:

1. GDQuest's [Godot User Interface Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KGXNbfsUHJbb5-s2Tujtjt4) - [Godot] has some peculiarities when it comes to making UIs that could trip up even the advanced users. This YouTube series covers, in depth this topic, with plenty of examples
1. Emilio's [Making Programs with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsiR7DILTczMLsN8qmMym7pYfJXynzK0) - a bit of trivia: the [Godot] editor is built using the [Godot] engine itself. So there's no surprise [Godot] can likewise be used to create programs and tool, not just games. This series covers UI and themes in an applied manner, by developing applications instead of games

### Shaders in [Godot]

Sharders are probably one of the parts [Godot] truly shines. It offers a simplified OpenGL-like scripting language (for coders) and a visual node editor (for designers) that are ridiculously easy to use. Apart from these, it comes with simplified models for creating materials directly in the options panel - the inspector.

[Godot] is very flexible when it comes to VFX driven by shaders. The following resources introduce you to shaders in [Godot], starting slow and ramping it up in the second entry of the list with examples to get you going in both 2D and 3D:
1. GDQuest's [Intro to Shaders in Godot: 2D and 3D Water Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KHqNMYmTwtsYTeTrqrRP_fP)
1. GDQuest's [Visual Shader Editor in Godot 3.1: Dissolve Shader](https://youtu.be/sf_Dc4ew3eM)
1. Gonkee's [Godot Shaders playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9NDikg3iIaXtGQY6HIgzUxfuMTkybzyx)
1. Bastiaan Olij's [Godot Grass shader tutorial](https://youtu.be/uMB3-g8v1B0)

### Extending [Godot]

One of the great aspects of [Godot] is that it can radically be customized to fit anyone's needs, having a very powerful editor plugin system. Editor tools can be built that run real-time during the development of the game phase, directly within the editor, extending it with new panels and functionality.

In this list we start with the official documentation, which goes through the necessary steps to building plugins of different sorts, then we have an actual real-case example:

1. [Godot editor plugins official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/plugins/editor/index.html)
1. GDQuest's [Smart Moving Platforms in Godot: waypoint system and Tool mode tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZWO2WiH9p9s)

### Multiplayer in [Godot]

[Godot] offers both high-level and low-level multiplayer protocols and APIs for both simple and advanced coordination between clients and servers. RPCs (remote procedure calls) are what [Godot] uses in order to call and sync peers.

At the time of this writing there aren't that many educational resources on handling multiplayer systems in [Godot]. We hope that the following list is enough to put you on the right track:

1. GDQuest's [Intro to Multiplayer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KHohKIdqyTHRr96zYreZMC7) in [Godot]
1. [Godot Networking](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/networking/index.html)

### Getting (un)stuck

While the above resources are enough to explore a significant part of [Godot], it isn't an exhaustive list and there are many holes left to be filled. Here are some great places to start looking for answerers when you get stuck:

- GDQuest's [New Features in Godot 3.1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KEN1pQVRD4an4Ykd1i9t3t9)
- [KidsCanCode Godot recipes](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/)
- [reddit list](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/an0iq5/godot_tutorials_list_of_video_and_written/)
- [Godot community page](https://godotengine.org/community)

1. [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) - [Godot]'s programing language is heavily inspired by [Python](https://www.python.org/) and so **we recommend you explore** core programming algorithms and data structures using it
