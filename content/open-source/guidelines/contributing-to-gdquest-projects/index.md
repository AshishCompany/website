Want to become a contributor? Thank you kindly for taking the time to give everyone a hand! ðŸ˜„

To make it as smooth and as pleasant as possible for everyone to work together, we'll ask you to:

1. **Communicate**. Let people know what you're working on, join discussion on the issues, and open your own!
1. **Be and mindful of the contributors' and the maintainers' time**. Everyone here is providing their expertise benevolently. As much as we are thankful for detailed suggestions and reports, we may not be able to get to every one of them in a timely fashion.
1. **Be respectful**. We consider that respect is essential for fullfilling and productive human relationships. We want to keep our projects welcoming for everyone.

Also be sure to check our [Communication Guidelines]({{< ref "/open-source/guidelines/kind-communication-guidelines/index.md" >}})!

## Writing great bug reports and requests

When you report a bug or request a new feature or an improvement, we need information to fix it.

To write a great bug report:

1. Provide a **list of actionable steps** to reproduce the bug
1. Mention the software version and your operating system you are working with
1. If the program prints an **error in the console**, copy it as text or take a screenshot

You can surround the error with triple backticks: `\`\`\``. It will appear like so:

```
found bundled python: C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\python
[bpy.data.window_managers['WinMan']...KeyMap]
Registered Power Sequencer with 71 modules
```

### Taking screenshots

If you are on Windows, I highly recommend [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/), an amazing open source program. It lets you take annotated screenshots, animated GIFs, and video clips. On Linux, you can use the built-in tool in your distribution: screenshot on Ubuntu, Spectacle on KDE...
