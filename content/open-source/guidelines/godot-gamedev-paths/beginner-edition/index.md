This guide is **the starting place for learning game development** with [Godot](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT): the _ultimate beginner-edition_. It covers a list of **curated online free resources** that take you from **no-programming experience whatsoever to your first full-blown game projects**, albeit small ones. Why? Because great _projects start humble_ driven by enthusiasm and a lot of work!

It's a dream come true for many GameDev students and hobbyists out there to work in big houses that create AAA-games. But alongside the big houses, especially lately there has been a surge of indie developers that produce stunning quality video games such as (to name just a few):

- [NinjaTheory](https://ninjatheory.com/)'s [Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice](https://www.hellblade.com/) - a masterpiece surpassed only by very few. It's amazing what a small team of dedicated game developers can do these days
- [RedHook](https://www.redhookgames.com/)'s [Darkest Dungeon](http://www.darkestdungeon.com/) - another masterpiece project that basically created an entirely new category of games
- [Playdead](https://playdead.com/)'s [Limbo](https://playdead.com/games/limbo/) & [Inside](https://playdead.com/games/inside/) - both of which have amazing atmosphere and stories driven through game mechanics and small puzzles rather than narration, making them unique in the industry

Game creation at this level has been, in great part, made possible with the help of game engine developers that have given their product for free, even though some of the more famous ones _limit the freedom to students and hobbyists_ that work on personal non-monetized projects.

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is unlike any other game engine out there. It relies entirely on a **small crowd-funded team that shoots for the stars**, going head-to-head against the big boys in the industry. The game engine is already packed with a ridiculous number of features making 2D-game creation both enjoying and rewarding. Apart from that the team works closely with the [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) representatives in order to push the 3D pipeline to the limit.

On top of that [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is **entirely free and open source software (FOSS)**, with the most permissive license out there - [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). This means there's no limit to what a good team of developers can do with it. **It's an amazing time for anyone wanting to be a game developer!**

## Getting started with game development

Many enthusiasts starting on a journey to learn a new topic or skill **quickly become swamped by the sheer amount of information out there**. Nowadays, the problem isn't access to information as it once was, but rather **too much scattered information**. There's also the problem that most of it **isn't exactly respectable quality**, because anyone can put anything on the internet without any filters and quality control.

That said, **we, here at [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/), have done the work for you** by creating this **curated list of free online resources** that get you from **no-programming experience to your first full-blown game projects!**

_Buckle your seatbelts, it going to be an awesome ride!_

### Introduction for the total beginner

This section is for the total beginner that has little to no idea about the game industry nor the game creation process. It introduces high-level concepts that give some insights into what is to be expected.

1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s very own starter guide - [Become a Game Developer: How to Learn to Code](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/game-design/godot/become-a-game-creator/first-steps-programming/)
1. [Sykoo](https://www.youtube.com/user/SykooTV/)'s [How To Get into Game Development! (Teachers, School, Self-Taught and MORE!)](https://youtu.be/EL_Le8B_iCo)
1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s [Game Engines: what are they and how to choose the right one?](https://youtu.be/2tZK75R2K2c)

### Getting started with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) & your first game(s)

Instead of the booooring step-by-step traditional approach of going over the theory and explaining the interface of the engine, then going through the features etc. we're going to **focus on a hands-on approach!** Best way of learning something new is through a balanced practice-theory approach. That's why we have also included a few resources that do go through the theory, but **our recommendation is to start off with the heavy hands-on resources first** and if you get stuck or if you want to understand some game engine editor & programming concepts, then go through the theory and abstract explanations.

1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s [Intro to GDScript for Programming Beginners](https://youtu.be/UcdwP1Q2UlU) - **fundamentals of programming using GDScript**, the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) scripting language. This is _mostly optional_ for people that have basic programming knowledge
1. [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/)'s [Make Your First 2D Game with Godot](https://youtu.be/Mc13Z2gboEk) & it's [associated GitHub project repository](https://github.com/GDquest/Your-First-Game-Godot-2d-Platformer) - the 1st part of **a complete free course that goes through the creation steps for a Mario platformer-like clone**
1. [KidsCanCode](http://kidscancode.org/) [Mobile Game: Circle Jump](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/games/circle_jump/) - an **end-to-end game development series** going through the process of building a one-touch abstract, but attractive mobile game
1. [BornCG](https://www.youtube.com/user/cgboorman)'s [3D Roll the Ball](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLda3VoSoc_TSBBOBYwcmlamF1UrjVtccZ) - including a tutorial series for creating a small 3D game from scratch as the 2D & 3D engines in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) have quite a few differences between them
1. Other useful resources:
    - [Godot step-by-step](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html). [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)'s official high-level theoretical guide that goes through the interface and features, explaining the most important ideas to get students started
    - [GDScript reference](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html). The official [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) **to bookmark** resource which explains GDScript core concepts. Every Godot game developer will, without a doubt, have to search a thing or two about GDScript and this is the no. 1 place to find the answerers

#### Unanswered Questions/Gaps

*The following ideas might have a better fit in __developers edition #94__*

- (this should go into beginner section) debunking the misconception that making games is super easy. Yes it can be easy in some cases, if we limit ourselves to some graphic shapes type of game (see KidsCanCode circle jump game), but most times when we think of games, especially nowadays we're thinking of AAA games. So it's important to have a deep understanding of what the game development workflow is and how to create realistic expectations

- destructuring gamedev: a discussion of what games are made of in terms of systems that aren't provided by the game engine itself. Especially reusable systems so that as we further our careers we won't have to start from scratch each time: save management system, cut-scene system, dialogue system, inventory system, AI system, multiplayer/network system etc. Of course some of these are game specific, for example an adventure game would most definitely have a dialogue system, but not necessarily an inventory system, while for RPGs inventory systems are a must. **missing-resource**: I don't know of any discussion/article on this topic, just scattered topics and not most not Godot-specific

- it might be worth noting that OpenRPG could be a good candidate for a step-by-step somewhat complex guide for game creation which includes some of the systems discussed above. **missing-resource**: I don't know of any complex yet manageable game tutorial/example that would fit in this category

### Become a more independent developer

> This milestone should help the reader strengthen their programming and game design fundamentals, as well as their understanding of Godot. Start to introduce fundamental design principles

1. GDQuest's [Game Design Tutorial](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/game-design/general/game-design-tutorial/) playlist - lots of beginner-friendly examples of how to get started on actual (small) game creation, from a designer point of view
1. Brackeys' [Basic Principles of Game Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8AT01tuyrk) - high-level ideas on how to think about objectives that make a game engaging and fun. How to structure the workflow around these ideas


### Going further

> Give the reader specific places and guides to go further with game design, game development, and Godot

There's a fine line between "going further" and swamping the student in advanced information and resources so I need some help curating and refining the idea here.

The topics/resources below could fit a lot better in the *developers edition (#94)*:

- http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/
- http://www.gameaipro.com/
- http://pcgbook.com/
- https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/gpugems_pref01.html

That said I don't have a specific guide/path in mind with these, but we could probably extract some of the info from these books and offer a guided walk-through of the most important systems/algorithms someone should focus on
By this stage we're probably talking beyond just programming and going into tangential topics & domains: general AI/machine-learning programming, art (visual & audio), animation, general design principles, concept-art, general programming algorithms (eg. https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html - fit for beginners), optimization-work, shaders, differences between OOP & FP etc.

Some notable resources for the advanced & curious people (not in any particular order):

- http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/: advanced formal (as in heavily math-oriented) collection of generic algorithms & data-structures
- https://thebookofshaders.com/, incomplete: one of the best explanations on (fragment) shader programming out there (fit for beginners)
- https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell: rather unusual being a wikibook, but this is the best place I found to start off with the FP concepts, although it's Haskell-oriented so it does heavily rely on Haskell coding, but the principles presented presented conceptually go from beginner to intermediate
- https://github.com/dwhitney/purescript-book: the PureScript (FP) book in the process of getting up to date to the latest PureScript version - task taken up by dwhitney, although it's PureScript-focused, it introduces FP principles and so it offers a pretty good intermediate point of view in comparison to OOP

note all linked resources are FREE

Alright, hopefully this is helpful

#### Unanswered Questions/Gaps

- what does it mean to be a Game Programmer? difference between it and Game Developer
- what other roles are there within a Game Development pipeline? It's a very complex world, there's graphics programming (shaders), art engineers (something somewhat new - people that focus on making tools for game developers to ease development), outright artists, etc.
- overview of career in gamedev: here would be a good opportunity to include links to interviews of freelancers, gamedevs etc.
