After a successful crowdfunding to create a Godot course in 2017, we are back with a new project [in collaboration with the Godot team](https://godotengine.org/article/gdquest-kickstarter-learn-2d-and-3d-game-creation-godot)!

{{< youtube 7OGxzJQAKmw >}}

We're going to create:

1. **Two complementary courses about 2d and 3d game creation**, based around a platform/adventure game inspired by Metroidvanias
2. **Two beginner-friendly video series for the official documentation** about 2d and 3d
3. Two **Free and Open Source game demos**

However, for that, we need your help.

Interested? You can find all the details on the **[Kickstarter campaign's page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/create-your-own-games-with-godot-the-free-game-eng/)**

In short, we are raising 14,000 â‚¬ to hire Guilherme, Pigdev, and Razvan, to create great tutorials together. And I will keep working alongside them full-time.

This time, we are releasing all our code as Free Software from day one! Both during and after the campaign.

We are also publishing new free tutorials every day during the Kickstarter! So make sure to subscribe to [GDquest's YoUTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/gdquest/).
