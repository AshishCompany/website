<!-- If this file goes under contents/docs be sure to start chapters with ##, not # -->

In the past few days we have been hard at work, improving your experience through our website. Since we create content in many forms, including living-documents along the more "regular" tutorials, we have been rethinking user interaction with the GDQuest website.

## Meet the new GDQuest website section

As you might know, we're using [Hugo](//gohugo.io/) to generate this website. Hugo is a static website builder, based on [Go](//golang.org/) language. Recently Go has added the ability to work with [modules](//blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) and the Hugo developers jumped right away on this waggon and started using the feature. What does all this tech-lingo mean to you, the regular GDQuest user and fan?

It means that we now have a beautiful [docs section](//gdquest.com/docs/) based on the excellent [Hugo learn theme](//learn.netlify.com).

This new website section has a handful of cool features and improvements:

- a search engine
- easy to navigate menu on the left-hand side
- easy to access <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> for long documents
- next/previous buttons for easy navigation through the menu entries
- attachment files section
- code highlights
- easy copy code content with a button

Since the <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> could be easily missed as it is hidden by default, we're including a snapshot showing it in action:

![Documents Pages ToC](./img/toc.png)

The <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> is placed on the left-hand side of the breadcrums area at the top of the page and stays visible on scroll for easy access.

## Until next time

We hope that this brings you great joy in browsing our content and a renewed interest in interacting with the GDQuest website! It certainly is a big change and a nice improvement for us, the core contributors, as well.

_For those of you interested in the tech-stuff, we highly recommend checking out the excellent Hugo learn theme. They really did a wonderful job with it._
