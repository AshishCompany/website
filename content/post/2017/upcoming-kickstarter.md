Over the past year, I’ve released many Krita tutorials. Back in December 2015, a lot people supported a Kickstarter campaign dedicated to the program and put their faith in me. This was a big surprise. I didn’t expect so many artists would be interested in the program. I also didn’t expect you to support a YouTuber that came out of nowhere. If you think about it, we are free to use this great application and not give anything back. You’re free to watch my tutorials and never share or buy one of my products. And yet many of you do support me. Many of you do support Krita. That’s part of the beauty of open source.

I spent a lot of time on those Krita tutorials, and I’m slowly getting to the end of the tunnel. It’s time for me to finish it and move on. I have a company, bills to pay... and I still can't make a living off videos for open source technologies. That's why I'm working on a new crowdfunding campaign for the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/)!


## The Godot community is incredible!

In early February, I met dozens of Godot contributors in Brussels. Godot is an impressive multiplatform 2-D and 3-D game engine. It was originally made in-house by Okam, an Argentinian game company, and was released for free in 2014. This tool is not only powerful: it is used by independent game companies and has a warm, lively community. We discussed the making of a crowdfunding campaign and the developers loved the idea!

A Kickstarter campaign will allow me to earn enough money to keep going for a few more months, to create high quality tutorials and to do a lot of communication around Godot, thus help new people learn about the engine. Tens of thousands have watched my Krita tutorials, and hundreds, if not thousands stumble upon the videos every day. Less than 20% of views on gdquest come from existing subscribers. Meaning 80% come from anyone on the internet.


### Why not use Patreon instead?

I've thought about it. Explored my options in depth. Patreon might seem interesting at first, but it's hard to get started today. I don't know a single tutorial maker who earns even decent money on the platform. Not even channels that are 5 to 10 times bigger than Gdquest, like Brackeys or Heartbeast. Allow me to share some numbers with you. To keep my spot in this business incubator, I must make €2500 of gross revenue a month on average in 2017. If you subtract taxes, hardware, various expenses for hardware, training, commuting to work... that’s what you need to make a modest living in France.

Moving forward, I want to work with other people, which will cost a lot more money. Patreon also seems to work mostly for individuals - when it works. So that's not the right platform to go for as far as GDquest is concerned.


## What will it all be about?

What do YOU want the tutorials to be about? The idea is to show you how to make a great little game with Godot, exploring more and more advanced topics as we go. The game will feature beautiful, open source game art, based off the techniques explained in the [Make Professional Painterly Game Art with Krita]({{< ref "product\krita-tutorial-1.md" >}}).

As far as the game genre is concerned, it'll be up to you. RPG? Platform? Shoot'em up? Your call. I will put up a vote and share the link on Youtube and social networks. The only thing I can tell you for sure is that it'll be a 2d game.

If you want to know when the Kickstarter is up, you can [subscribe to the Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest?sub_confirmation=1) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest). If you only want to know when the Godot training is out, or any of my training series, enter your email address below and I'll send you a message in due time!
