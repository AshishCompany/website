As part of the [2019 Godot Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/create-your-own-games-with-godot-the-free-game-eng), one of the stretch goals reached was a 3D character controller kit to help quickly prototype 3D games with an animated character. This project became Mannequiny, the Open 3D Mannequin for Godot.

The mannequin was made by [Luciano Mu√±oz](https://twitter.com/lucianomunoz_). The game code was built by Josh aka [Cheeseness](https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese) and Francois Belair aka [Razoric](https://twitter.com/Razoric480). It is fully open sourced under the MIT license and open to contributions at its [repository](https://github.com/GDquest/godot-3d-mannequin/). The 3D character is professionally animated, the controller works with both mouse+keyboard and gamepad, and it is supported by a camera rig that supports zoom-to-aim, auto-rotation, and level geometry collision zooming.

Version 0.2.0 is available to download as a [repository release](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-3d-mannequin/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (including the Blender file), or on the [Godot asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/440).

Additionally, you can learn how the character was built using our [3D character controller course](https://www.gdquest.com/post/2019/12/godot-3d-course-ea/)! Follow along to see how every piece came together.

Thank you to all our backers who supported this open source effort, and we hope to see this be useful to many among you!

See you next time, and keep working!
