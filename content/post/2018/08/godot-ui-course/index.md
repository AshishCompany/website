If you don't have the full [Godot 3 course](https://gumroad.com/l/godot-tutorial-make-professional-2d-games) and you are only interested in UI design, you can now get our UI master series as a stand-alone course! That way you only pay for the content you want! ðŸ˜Š

This initial release contains 25 tutorials, for over 3h30 of content. You'll learn to create:

1. Animated lifebars and gauges that follow monsters in the game
