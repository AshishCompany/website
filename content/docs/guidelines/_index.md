### Chapter 2

# Guidelines

Over time, the process of learning about and teaching tools, acquiring new skills and abilities, we gather enough experience to be able to see what works and what doesn't. The following pages are a **compilation of best practices** about using some of the tools we are experienced with, but also about more abstract and hands-on concepts such as: how to communicate in a helpful and kind way, how to prepare for making video tutorials and presentations and much more. "Contributing to" is all about _being efficient_ with your time and ours, in case you want to help out with content or with our projects.
