These writing guidelines are here to support our mission and goals:

1. Be honest and factual, share information openly.
1. Help bring people together, and make them feel welcome.
1. Share our knowledge efficiently.

Our writing style is meant to be accessible, clear, and informative, with a touch of personality.

## Our Tone ##

The tone of an article helps to keep readers interested and engaged. It also shows our personality.

Our tone is kind, genuine, clear, accessible, inclusive, and professional.

To achieve that, avoid exaggerations, unnecessary jargon, but also colloquial expressions.

Write as if you were addressing a fellow professional or adult student directly in a one-on-one setting. Aim for a welcoming feel without being overly close.

Address the reader directly with "you." When talking about yourself or the team, you can use "I" or "we." When talking about third parties, favor pronouns like "they" or "them."

Also, while we should keep the style of documents like these consistent, you're encouraged to show your personality in news posts and devlogs.

## Dos and don'ts ##

Here are specific guidelines to help communicate clearly to a broad audience, including non-native English speakers.

### Keep sentences short ###

**Keep sentences under 25 words**. Favor short sentences, that each communicates one idea.

Use paragraphs to group sentences related to a broader idea together. Whenever you change the topic or move on to another concept, add a new paragraph.

### Use the direct voice ###

Using the direct voice leads to slightly shorter sentences compared to the passive voice. It makes the action clear from the first few words.

Avoid the passive voice:

> The update_items function is used by the inventory system.

Favor the direct voice:

> The inventory system uses the update_items function.

## Structure ##

This section focuses on the structure of tutorials, articles, and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements.

### Headings ###

Use Title Case for document titles: "Getting Started with Godot." For other headings, only capitalize the first word: "Coding the character."

Always write a paragraph after a heading, including an introduction following a page's title.

On the web, only the document's title should use an H1 heading. Use H2 for sections, and H3 for sub-sections. Avoid nesting sub-sections past the H4 level.

### Links ###

For links, write a label that describes the action the user is taking, or the page they will arrive on. The label should be meaningful on its own. For example, instead of [official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NathanGDQuest), use [follow GDQuest on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanGDQuest).
