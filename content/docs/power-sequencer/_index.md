At GDQuest we edit all of our videos with Blender. It's a powerful tool, but its default workflow can feel a little slow. That's why we built [ Power Sequencer ](https://github.com/GDQuest/Blender-power-sequencer/), a **Free and Open Source** add-on that's all about helping you work efficiently and comfortably.
