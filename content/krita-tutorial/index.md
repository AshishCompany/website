## Volume 2 - Painterly game art and side-scrolling games

<img src="\img\page\game-art-quest\game-art-quest-painterly.png" alt="Game Art Quest volume 2 banner - painterly art" class="img-responsive"/>

In this second training, we will take a closer look at the game creation pipeline from a game artist's standpoint. We will create static assets for a side scrolling video game with a painterly art style, inspired by the work of VanillaWare (_Odin Sphere, Muramasa_) and Moon Studios (_Ori and the Blind Forest_).

## Volume 3 - Cel shaded game art and isometric games

This 3rd volume is dedicated to isometric game art. In this series, we will expand on the first 2 volumes, explore new drawing techniques as well as the characteristics of isometric games.

### Do you want to become a better 2d game artist?

You came to the right place! Using **Krita, a free and open source painting application**, Game Art Quest will show you both **essential concepts** and **concrete techniques** professionals use on a daily basis. It is a training series in 3 volumes. The first one is **completely free**.

In this series, **I will run you through the process of creating professional grade static assets for games**. I will share my workflow and my productivity tricks. Not only that! I will show you how Krita is becoming a solid option for professional work.

Although we’ll use Krita, the concepts you will learn apply to any painting application or medium. To become a more efficient game artist, you have to sharpen your observation skills and explore drawing techniques. These are the same regardless of the tools you are using, and that’s what we're going to see.

The series will also cover the unique constraints we game artists face in our work. As a game artist, you have to make assets with a target resolution and camera in mind. You have to carefully draw your alpha masks. More importantly, as a game artist, **your art has to support the gameplay: it shapes the game experience**.

If you don't know Krita yet, check out my [19 YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KE3FLHIE31UgmLdcqsZfXTw) dedicated to it! And [click here](https://krita.org/download/krita-desktop/) to download the application. It's available on Windows, Linux and Mac (_port in progress_).

Game Art Quest was funded [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/game-art-quest-make-professional-2d-art-with-krita) by 424 generous backers!

This page is a hub for all of the activity linked to the project. Here, you will find open source game assets, the free Krita training, as well as a frequently updated roadmap.
