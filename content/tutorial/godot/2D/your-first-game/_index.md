And more! All that in 2d. The course is compatible with **Godot 3.1+**.

## Pre-requisites

This course is for **beginners**. It gives quite a lot of details about programming and how Godot work, teaching you some good practices from the start.

While this is a step-by-step course, you should know:

2. How to use Godot's editor.

## Extended edition

We have a **premium edition** of this course with **extra lessons**, assignments, questions and answers, and more. In the extended version, you will learn to:

- Add 2D lights to your levels.
- Create bumpers to jump high.
- Add slope support.
- Use UI themes to improve the look of your interface.
