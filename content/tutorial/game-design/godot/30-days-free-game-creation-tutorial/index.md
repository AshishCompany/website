These tutorials are brought to you for free as part of the Kickstarter project [Make Professional 2d Games with Godot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/make-professional-2d-games-godot-engine-online-cou). It was funded in 12h, and plenty of stretch goals were unlocked already. Please check it out!

This is an Open Source project. Both the assets and the code are [available on Github](https://github.com/GDquest/Godot-30-days-tutorial-challenge-2017), with comments to help you learn directly from the examples.
