You want to learn game creation, but you don't know where to start? These guides are for you. We're here to help you take your first steps with programming, design, and more.

This section is still relatively empty. The guide [Learn to Code](learn-to/code) will get you started with computer programming, a recommended starting point to learn to use complex game engines such as [Godot]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/_index.md" >}}).
